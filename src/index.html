						<div class="bio">
						<p>Sun Chang is a 23-year-old Korean-American pianist and harpsichordist. After graduating from the Bienen School of Music at Northwestern University in 2017 with a BMus, she is now studying at the Royal Academy of Music in London in pursuit of a Master’s in Historical Performance. Between degrees, she traveled and performed on Holland America Line as part of Lincoln Center Stage Piano Quintet. The LCS quintet performs six nights a week, with repertoire ranging from major piano quintets by Brahms, Schumann and Dvorak, to crossover works arranged specifically for the quintet, and original works commissioned by Holland America. 

						<p>In May 2018 with the help of soprano Harrah Friedlander and <a href="https://www.luminarts.org/" class="link">@Luminarts</a> Cultural Foundation Sun organised concerts celebrating underrepresented voices in music. She teamed up with Chicago-area artists to showcase works by women from the baroque time period such as Hildegard von Bingen, Isabella Leonarda, Elizabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, Francesca Caccini, Caterina Assadra, and Barbara Strozzi. Take a look at the program <a href="The-Second-Sex-in-the-City-Program.pdf" class="link">here</a> - designed by <a href="https://www.zhookie.com/" class="link">@Julie</a>. In addition to this fun project, she collaborated with Dr. Stephen Alltop to perform Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 14 with the Champaign-Urbana Symphony Orchestra.

						<p>While earning her BMus with Mr. Alan Chow, she was also an active member of Chicago’s music scene. She gave a recital at the Chicago Cultural Centre, was a featured artist on Live from WFMT, where her two-hour recital was broadcast live, and collaborated frequently with the area’s leading chamber orchestra, Camerata Chicago. As a result, she gave performances of Rhapsody in Blue, Mozart Concerto No. 27, and Saint-Saens' Wedding Cake with Camerata Chicago under the baton of Maestro Drostan Hall and Dan Sommerville. She also won two of the main scholarship competitions in the area, becoming a Luminarts Fellow in 2014, and receiving the Jerome and Elaine Nerenberg Foundation Scholarship from the Musician’s Club of Women in 2015. 

						<p>Despite her solo engagements, Sun’s biggest passion is chamber music because she believes that musicking is a social activity. At Northwestern, she played continuo in the Baroque Music Ensemble, played keyboard in the Contemporary Music Ensemble, gave multiple recitals with violinist Miki Nagahara, and played in various chamber formations. After graduating, on top of playing in piano quintets, she always found ways to play other musicians, whether it be for groupmuse concerts or for public outreach events like Bach In The Subways, and she will continue to seek out ensemble opportunities for the rest of her life.  Her plan is to found, direct, conduct and play in a female-centred chamber ensemble. 

						<p>Sun is very grateful to her supporters for everything they’ve contributed to her career and humanity. She would especially like to thank Dr. Peter Mack for being her teacher of more than a decade, and for supporting her in her formative years. In addition to having such an excellent primary piano teacher, she is fortunate to have learned from many different teachers at various summer festivals. Mostly she would like to thank her family for the incredible support and for loving her into being.

<!-- 					<p>Sun Chang is a 23-year-old Korean-American pianist and harpsichordist. She is currently playing with Friction Quartet aboard the MS Oosterdam as part Holland America Line’s  Lincoln Center Stage Piano Quintet. The LCS quintet performs six nights a week, with repertoire ranging from major piano quintets by Brahms, Schumann and Dvorak, to crossover works arranged specifically for the quintet, and original works commissioned by Holland America.</p>
					<p>Sun earned her BMus at the Bienen School of Music at Northwestern University as a student of Alan Chow in 2017. During her studies, in addition to her involvements within the school, she was also an active member of Chicago’s music scene. She gave a recital at the Chicago Cultural Center, was a featured artist on Live from WFMT, where her two-hour recital was broadcast live, and collaborated frequently with the area’s leading chamber orchestra, Camerata Chicago. As a result, she gave performances of Rhapsody in Blue, Mozart Concerto No. 27, and Saint-Saens' Wedding Cake with Camerata Chicago under the baton of Maestro Drostan Hall and Dan Sommerville. She also won two of the main scholarship competitions in the area, becoming a Luminarts Fellow in 2014, and receiving the Jerome and Elaine Nerenberg Foundation Scholarship from the Musician’s Club of Women in 2015.</p>
					<p>During her year abroad at the Royal Academy of Music in London, she became more involved with the world of historical performance, taking harpsichord and fortepiano lessons from Carole Cerasi. She was fortunate to also study piano with professor Rustem Hayroudinoff during her time there.</p>
					<p>Although her solo engagements are many, Sun is almost always involved in a chamber music project because she loves to make music with others. At Northwestern, she played continuo in the Baroque Music Ensemble, played keyboard in the Contemporary Music Ensemble, gave multiple recitals with violinist Miki Nagahara, and played in various chamber formations. She also sang in University Chorale, Chapel Choir, and University Singers. She continues to seek collaborative opportunities. Next April, she will be playing Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 14 with the Champaign-Urbana Symphony Orchestra conducted by Stephen Alltop. She will also be returning to Chicago and New York to work on a project focusing on women composers.</p> -->
